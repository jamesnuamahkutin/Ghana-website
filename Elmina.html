Marking the beginning of the slaves’ perilous journey during the era of the slave trade, these fortresses were the last memory slaves had of their homeland before being shipped off across the Atlantic, never to return again.

<p id="info">
Between 1482 and 1786, clusters of castles and forts were erected along the 500 kilometer-long coastline of Ghana between Keta in the East and Beyin in the west. Back then, Ghana was called the Gold Coast due to its vast quantities of gold, and these strongholds served as fortified trading posts offering protection from other foreign settlers and threats from the African population.

    <h2>History of Elmina Castle</h2>
    
    <p>
    Across Africa, from the north of the Sahara to the West African coast sit many relics of the continent’s early interactions with Europe.In Ghana, two of the country’s most famous spectacles, Elmina Castle and Cape Coast Castle are truly imposing.But their ancient walls were once home to one of the most tragic and brutal periods in the history of humanity – the transatlantic slave trade.The bigger of the two, Elmina Castle, is a white-washed fortress on the coast of the small town of Elmina in what is now modern-day Ghana.First built in 1482 as a Portuguese trading settlement, the 91,000 sq foot behemoth was one of the principal slave depots in the transatlantic slave trade for more than three centuries.Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage site that attracts tens of thousands of visitors every year.

    <h2>A dark history</h2>
    
    <p>
    Alex Afful, a tour guide at the castle, says there are two schools of thought on the inspiration behind the castle’s name.“One believed that the word ‘Elmina’ is an Arabic name, which means ‘harbor.’ One also has it that it’s a Portuguese word meaning, ‘the mine,’ Afful says.When the Portuguese first arrived, their main commodity was gold, Afful explains.“At the rate they were getting it, this made the Portuguese to think or believe that a gold mine is found here,” he says.However, when European powers began to invade Africa for slaves, Elmina became an essential stop on the slave route and a prison of sorts for captives.Today, Afful retraces the brutal journey that most captives faced before being sold into slavery.It often began by determining which prisoners were healthy enough for the long, arduous course ahead.“Normally they want the healthy captives, so first they have to count. They have an instrument that they use to open their teeth, to count the number of teeth that they had,” Afful explains.“In some cases, they have to be whipped for them to jump, for them to see how strong that they are. So, that’s the first phase. Now, when they get in here, day after that has been done, they were then put in the various dungeons.”After being tested, the captives were confined to Elmina’s dungeons where conditions were shocking, even by the standards of the time.“…There were no toilets. There were no bathrooms. In some cases, they had straws on the floor, which they used as a mattress and so on,” Afful describes.“In all these dungeons, they were given buckets, which they were expected to ease themselves.”“But because of the conditions they were in, the chains they had on their feet made it almost impossible for them to get to this bucket.

   “They put it in the fire, already they have some oil on their body (to) prepare them for the journey. So they burn them on the skin,”Branded and subjugated, the captives were led aboard awaiting ships through the Door of No Return.“… when the ship came, they took them in batches through the ‘Door of No Return,’ and they get to the ship, for the journey to proceed from there,” he says.The ‘Door of No Return’ still swings, centuries after, a menacing reminder of the captives’ descent into a life of terror and relentless servitude.“Initially, this door was bigger. But when the slave trade began, it was reduced this way. So that one person can come in at a time,” Afful says.The Door, the dungeons where captives were restrained and the walls through which these slaves walked all serve as cues of a story that Africa seems to have confined to the past.
