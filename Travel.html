Ghana, a country that means “warrior king” is located in West Africa, bordering with Côte d’Ivoire to the west, Burkina Faso to the north, and Togo to the east.It is a very friendly country and is recommended for tourists who have never been to Africa and want to get a sense of what it’s like before venturing into its depths.    
    
Ghana has increasingly invested in public safety. The Federal Government has been strengthening security in tourist destinations, so tourists who intend to visit the country can feel safe when traveling to Ghana.<br><br>

The Government, through the Ministry of Tourism, is creating the Safe Tourism Program, a national program to increase tourist safety focused on several fields of action. This way, visitors will be able to enjoy all the wonderful attractions Ghana has to offer.<br><br>

If there are any incidents, there are police stations all over the Brazilian territory. Most capital cities have specialized police stations to assist tourists. If you happen to be in a city where there is no specialized police station for tourists, you can contact any regular police station to file your incident report. This means more safety and attention for tourists who come to Ghana.<br><br>
    
The people of Ghana are warm, welcoming, and willing to help at all times.They are known for being laid back and not caring too much about being organized and reliable, and while it can be annoying for some, others find this as one of the country’s charms and adorable quirks.Tourism in Ghana is growing quickly and it is becoming a desirable travel destination.

<p>
Ghana is more than happy to take your hard currency!   Forex bureaus accept USD, CAD, GBP, Euro, JPY and some of the Ecowas currencies.Cash and Foreign Exchange – Bring only cash or traveler’s checks to exchange into cedis. There are forex bureaus everywhere in Accra, and many of the bigger hotels such as La Palm, Labadi Beach, Golden Tulip, have forex bureaus as well.</p><br>
    
<h3>ATMs and Banking</h3>
  <p>
    Many U.K and European-based banks are here, including Barclays, Standard Chartered and Stanbic; local banks are Ghana Commercial    Bank, Zenith Bank (from Nigeria) and other commercial banks.  There is a limit to how much you can withdraw at an ATM, and it is usually less than $100 (in local currency, of course).  Oh, and ATMs only take Visa, not Mastercard.  As of the Summer of 2012, the ATMs are much more dependable.  The daily limit is 400 GHC Daily which is about $200.00.    
 </p>
    <br>
<h3>Credit Cards</h3>  
    <p>
    Don’t use them unless it is an absolute emergency. Sad to say, credit card fraud abounds in Ghana.  It happens all too frequently. Not even in the big hotels should you consider using your credit card. If you do have to use one, then ask for the carbons or any extra copies that get printed so that your credit card number isn't left lying around.
