<p>There’s a lot to learn from a group of people by the way they put together their meals. The ingredients, cooking methods and energy they apply into feeding themselves extend beyond nourishment, with their culinary skills reflecting different beliefs, traditions and habits. As such, experiencing and experimenting with local traditional foods provides an education of the culture, too. </p>    
    
<p>Traditional Ghanaian food is typified by the distribution of food crops. With the prominence of tropical produce like corn, beans, millet, plantains and cassava, most ethnic groups creatively employ these foodstuffs to make mouth-watering dishes for their nourishment. Below are some dishes to introduce you to the scope of local Ghanaian food.</p>

    <p>
    This is one of the most simple Ghanaian dishes to prepare. It doesn't demand so much time and skills to complete.
    You just have to boil yam, and then prepare the palava sauce. The major ingredient here is spinach which will be chopped.
    Then other things like fish, beef etc.

    <p>
        Banku is one of those local Ghanaian dishes that is made from fermented corn. The dish is served as orange
        size balls along with fried fish or meat, pepper or okro stew. However, the preparation isn't that simple and easy 
        especially when it's okro stew. All the same, it'll be worthwhile if you know how to cook this meal as a typical Ghanaian lady.

    <p>
    In the Eastern and Ashanti regions of Ghana, one meal guaranteed to work its wonder is fufu and goat light soup, the proud dish of the Akan. Fufu is a staple food across West Africa but in Ghana, it is made by pounding a mixture of boiled cassava and plantains into a soft sticky paste to go along with aromatic and spicy tomato soup.

    <p>
    No list of traditional Ghanaian foods would be complete without this savoury side dish. Kelewele is an instant favourite among anyone who tries it, even those who aren’t big fans of peppery food. Usually sold as a snack or side dish all over Accra, it is made by frying soft plantains that have been soaked in a medley of peppers, ginger and garlic.
